Project Mimir is a low-cost Braille embosser built using 3D Printer parts. It is accompanied by a purpose-built GCode Slicer that converts text into Braille, and Braille into GCode for the embosser. The slicer currently supports .txt, .docx and .pdf file types, and additionally has voice-to-text capabilities for direct speech input.

The project is open source because we believe in making accessible technology truly accessible, and ease of availability of embossers will allow more people to produce their own Braille, opening up new avenues in literature and academics for the visually impaired.

Project Mimir is currently in active development.
